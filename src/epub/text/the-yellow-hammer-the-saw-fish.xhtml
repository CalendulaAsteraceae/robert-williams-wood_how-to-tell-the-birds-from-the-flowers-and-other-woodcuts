				<p>
					<span>The Yellow-Hammer, or the Flicker,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>More briefly “Golden-winged Wood-picker,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My drawing of which <em>striking</em> bird</span>
					<br/>
					<span>May seem to you perhaps absurd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You even may suspect I stole</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The idea from some Totem-pole:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But when you gaze upon the Fish,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You lose all patience and say “Pish!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I don’t believe you ever saw</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A Saw‑fish look like this, O Pshaw!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There certainly is some mistake,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This is a saw‑did Nature fake,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In fact a perfect cata‑clysm</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of fishy Yellow-journalism.”</span>
