				<p>The Gnu conspicuously wears<br/>
				His coat of gnumerous bristling hairs,<br/>
				While, as we see, the modest Newt<br/>
				Of such a coat is destitute.<br/>
				(I’m only telling this to you,<br/>
				And it is strictly “entre gnu”)<br/>
				In point of fact the Newt is nude,<br/>
				And therefore he does not obtrude,<br/>
				But hides in some secluded gnook,<br/>
				Beneath the surface of the brook.<br/>
				It’s almost more than he can bear,<br/>
				To issue slyly from his lair,<br/>
				And snatch a hasty breath of air,<br/>
				His need of which is absolute,<br/>
				Because, you see, he is a pneu-t.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1" id="noteref-1" epub:type="noteref">1</a></p>
