				<p>The sacred Ibis, one might say,<br/>
				Was classified a “Bird-of-Pray”<br/>
				His body, after death, was dried,<br/>
				Embalmed in pitch, and mummyfied,<br/>
				And thus was handed down to us<br/>
				In some old King’s sarcophagus.<br/>
				The Mallow, growing in the bogs,<br/>
				(’Ibiscus termed by pedagogues)<br/>
				Is much opposed to dessication,<br/>
				And bears no marks of veneration.</p>
